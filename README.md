Zomboy's Multiboxing Tool is an application that allows you to be able to switch between EVE clients using only the top numbered key row in your keyboard.

Being able to quickly cycle between characters at the press of a button (instead of Alt-tabbing, which involves more actions) makes the difference when handling several characters at once in a fight. With proper EVE profile management, you can activate several modules per second on various accounts.

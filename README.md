Zomboy's Multiboxing Tool is a small script I've written to be able to switch between EVE clients using only the top number key row. 

Being able to quickly cycle between characters at the press of a button (instead of Alt-tabbing, where you need to focus on switching windows) makes the difference when handling several characters at once in a fight.

## Instructions

  1. Download [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
  2. Download this repository and extract it to a folder
  3. Edit the `toons.txt` file.
        * On each line, add the name of your EVE Online toon, followed by a `TAB` character and a number
  4. Right click on `main.ahk` and select **"Run as administrator"**
  5. You will now be able to switch between EVE Online characters by pressing on his/her corresponding number key.

Zomboy's Multiboxing Tool is an application that allows you to be able to switch between EVE clients using only the top numbered key row in your keyboard.

Being able to quickly cycle between characters at the press of a button (instead of Alt-tabbing, which involves more actions) makes the difference when handling several characters at once in a fight. With proper EVE profile management, you can activate several modules per second on various accounts.

## Instructions

  1. [Download AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
  2. [Download this repository](https://github.com/zomboy-alfrir/multiboxing-tool/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a folder.
  3. Edit the `toons.txt` file. On each line, add the name of your EVE Online toon, followed by a `TAB` character and a number.
  4. Right click on `gui.ahk` and select **"Run as administrator"**.
  5. You will now be able to switch between EVE Online characters by pressing on his/her corresponding number key.

## About hotkeys

  * You can re-use the same hotkey with several characters. This is useful when you have those in the same account, since they can never be online at the same time.
